## 📦 What Was Added

### New Files:

- `src/lib/email.js` - Email service with Nodemailer
- `src/lib/generateTicketImage.js` - Server-side ticket image generation
- `.env.local.example` - Environment variable template
- `EMAIL_SETUP.md` - Detailed setup guide

### Updated Files:

- `src/app/api/bookings/route.js` - Added email sending after booking creation
- `package.json` - Added `nodemailer` and `canvas` dependencies

### Dependencies Added:

- `nodemailer` - Email sending library
- `canvas` - Server-side Canvas API for image generation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

The packages are already installed, but if you need to reinstall:

```bash
npm install nodemailer canvas --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 2. Configure Gmail (Required)

You need to set up Gmail App Password to send emails:

1. Go to your Google Account → Security
2. Enable 2-Step Verification
3. Create an App Password for "Mail"
4. Add to `.env.local`:

```env
GMAIL_USER="your_email@gmail.com"
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD="your_16_char_app_password"
```

📖 **See `EMAIL_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions!**

### 3. Test It!

1. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Book a ticket on your EventHub site
3. Check your email inbox for the ticket!

## 🎯 How It Works

```
User Books Ticket
       ↓
Booking Created in Database
       ↓
Ticket Image Generated (Canvas)
       ↓
Email Composed (HTML)
       ↓
Email Sent (Background Process)
       ↓
User Receives Beautiful Email with Ticket Attached
```

**Important:** Email is sent asynchronously using `setImmediate()`, so:

- Booking response is instant
- Email is sent in the background
- If email fails, booking still succeeds

## 📧 Email Contents

The user receives:

- **Subject:** 🎉 Your Ticket for [Event Name] - Booking Confirmed!
- **Body:**
  - Personalized greeting
  - Event details (date, time, location, venue)
  - Booking information (ID, tickets, amount)
  - Instructions for using the ticket
  - Contact information
- **Attachment:** `ticket-[booking-id].png` with QR code

## 🔍 Monitoring

Check your terminal logs for email status:

✅ Success:

```
Sending ticket email to: user@example.com
✅ Ticket email sent successfully: <message-id>
```

⚠️ Warning (email not configured):

```
⚠️ Email transporter not configured. Skipping email send.
```

❌ Error:

```
❌ Error sending ticket email: [error details]
```

## 🎨 Email Design

The email features:

- Gradient header (blue to purple)
- Clean, modern layout
- Responsive design
- Event card with icons
- Highlighted booking details
- Professional footer
- Mobile-friendly

## 📱 What Users Get

1. **Immediate Booking Confirmation** on the website
2. **Email with ticket** in their inbox
3. **Downloadable ticket image** from "My Events" page
4. **QR code** for event check-in

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Optional: Disable Email

If you don't want to send emails yet, simply don't set the `GMAIL_USER` and `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` variables. The app will log a warning but continue working.

### Optional: Use Different Email Service

The code uses Nodemailer, which supports many email services:

- Gmail (current setup)
- SendGrid
- Amazon SES
- Mailgun
- Postmark
- Any SMTP server

Edit `src/lib/email.js` to change the transporter configuration.

## 🔐 Security Notes

✅ **Already Secured:**

- App Password (not regular password)
- Environment variables (not in code)
- `.env.local` in `.gitignore`

⚠️ **Remember:**

- Never commit `.env.local` to git
- Use different credentials for production
- Consider professional email service for production

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Email not configured" message?

→ Add `GMAIL_USER` and `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` to `.env.local`

### "Invalid login" error?

→ Make sure you're using App Password, not regular Gmail password
→ Enable 2-Step Verification on Google Account

### Email not received?

→ Check spam/junk folder
→ Check terminal logs for errors
→ Verify Gmail credentials are correct

### Booking fails completely?

→ This shouldn't happen - email errors don't affect booking
→ If booking fails, it's a different issue (check database/validation)
