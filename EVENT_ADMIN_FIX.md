# 🛠️ Event Admin Assignment Fix

## Problem

Admin assignments weren't showing up in the event admin list because there was no way to track which specific event each admin was assigned to.

## Solution

Created a junction table `event_admins` to properly track event-admin relationships.

## 🚀 How to Fix

### Step 1: Create the Junction Table

Run this SQL in your Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create a simple event_admins table to track which admins are assigned to which events
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS event_admins (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  event_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES events(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  assigned_by TEXT NOT NULL,
  assigned_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(event_id, user_id)
);

-- Add indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_event_admins_event_id ON event_admins(event_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_event_admins_user_id ON event_admins(user_id);
```

### Step 2: Test the Assignment

1. Go to your super admin dashboard
2. Navigate to Manage Events → [Select Event] → Admins tab
3. Search for a user and assign them as admin
4. The admin should now appear in the "Current Admins" list for that specific event

## ✅ What This Fixes

- ✅ **Event-Specific Admins**: Each admin is assigned to specific events only
- ✅ **Proper Admin Lists**: GET endpoint shows only admins assigned to that event
- ✅ **No Duplicate Assignments**: UNIQUE constraint prevents duplicate assignments
- ✅ **Clean Data**: CASCADE deletes clean up assignments when events/users are deleted
- ✅ **Performance**: Indexes ensure fast queries

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Assign Admin**: Creates record in `event_admins` table + updates user role
2. **View Admins**: Queries `event_admins` table joined with `users` table
3. **One Admin Per Event**: UNIQUE constraint prevents multiple assignments
4. **Clean Relationships**: Foreign keys ensure data integrity

## 📁 Files Modified

- `src/app/api/admin/events/[id]/admins/route.js` - Updated to use junction table
- `create_event_admins_table.sql` - SQL migration for junction table

## 🧪 Testing

After running the SQL migration:

1. Assign an admin to Event A
2. Assign a different admin to Event B
3. Check that each event only shows its assigned admin
4. Try assigning the same admin to multiple events (should prevent duplicates)

That's it! Your event admin assignment system should now work properly! 🎉
