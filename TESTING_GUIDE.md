## üîç Where to Check

### 1. Browser Console
Open DevTools (F12) and look for:
```
=== PAYMENT VERIFICATION REQUEST ===
Order ID: order_xxxxx
Payment ID: pay_xxxxx
Booking ID: booking_xxxxx
‚úÖ SIGNATURE VERIFIED - PAYMENT IS AUTHENTIC
‚úÖ BOOKING CONFIRMED SUCCESSFULLY
‚úÖ TICKET EMAIL SENT SUCCESSFULLY
```

### 2. Database (Supabase)
Check bookings table:
```sql
SELECT 
  id, 
  status, 
  paymentId, 
  tickets, 
  totalAmount,
  createdAt,
  updatedAt
FROM bookings
ORDER BY createdAt DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Successful booking should show:**
- status: `CONFIRMED`
- paymentId: `pay_xxxxxxxxxx` (actual Razorpay payment ID)
- updatedAt: Recent timestamp

**Failed booking should show:**
- status: `FAILED`
- paymentId: `PENDING_order_xxxxx` (still pending)
- failureReason: Error message

### 3. Email Inbox
Check for email with:
- Subject: "üéâ Payment Successful! Your Ticket for [Event Name]"
- Ticket image attached as PNG
- Booking details in email body

### 4. Razorpay Dashboard
Go to dashboard.razorpay.com:
- Check "Payments" section
- Verify payment shows as "captured"
- Order ID should match booking

### 5. My Events Page
Navigate to `/my-events`:
- Should see all confirmed bookings
- Each booking shows:
  - Event name
  - Number of tickets
  - Booking status
  - Ticket download option

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Still shows "Booking Not Completed" after successful payment
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify crypto import exists in create-order route
3. Check Razorpay keys in environment variables
4. Look for signature verification logs

### Issue: Redirect doesn't work
**Solution:**
1. Verify `useRouter` import in BookingModal
2. Check if `/my-events` page exists
3. Look for navigation errors in console

### Issue: Ticket email not received
**Solution:**
1. Check spam folder
2. Verify Gmail SMTP settings
3. Check email address in user profile
4. Look for email sending errors in server logs

### Issue: Payment succeeds but booking stays PENDING
**Solution:**
1. Check verification API logs
2. Verify booking lookup query
3. Check if paymentId format is correct
4. Look for database update errors
