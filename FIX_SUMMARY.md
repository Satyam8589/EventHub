# Event Cards Not Showing in Deployment - Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Logging (src/app/page.js & src/app/events/page.js)

Added comprehensive console logging to track:

- API fetch attempts
- Response status codes
- Data received
- Event counts
- Specific error messages

**What to check in browser console:**

```
✅ "Fetching events from /api/events..."
✅ "Response status: 200"
✅ "Total events fetched: X" (where X > 0)
✅ "Featured events: X"
✅ "Upcoming events to display: X"
```

❌ **Red flags:**

- "Response status: 404" - API route not found
- "Response status: 500" - Server error
- "Total events fetched: 0" - Database issue
- "API Error Response: ..." - Check the error details

### 2. Added Empty State Handling

If no events are found, instead of showing blank space:

- Featured section: Shows "No featured events available"
- Upcoming section: Shows "No upcoming events available"

This helps identify if the issue is:

- No events in database
- API not returning events
- Frontend not receiving events

### 3. Created Health Check Endpoint (src/app/api/health/route.js)

New endpoint: `/api/health`

**Test it:**

```bash
# In your browser or curl
https://your-domain.com/api/health
```

**Healthy response:**

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "eventCount": 3,
  "env": {
    "hasSupabaseUrl": true,
    "hasSupabaseKey": true,
    "hasDatabaseUrl": true
  }
}
```

**Unhealthy response:**

```json
{
  "status": "unhealthy",
  "message": "Database connection failed",
  "error": "...",
  "env": { ... }
}
```

### 4. Improved Error Handling

- Better error messages in console
- Checks for empty arrays
- Validates response before processing

## Deployment Checklist

### Before Deploying:

1. ✅ Commit all changes
2. ✅ Push to repository
3. ✅ Verify environment variables in deployment platform
4. ✅ Check Supabase is accessible from deployment platform

### After Deploying:

1. ✅ Visit `/api/health` - Should show "healthy"
2. ✅ Visit `/api/events` - Should return events array
3. ✅ Open home page and check console
4. ✅ Look for console logs about fetching events
5. ✅ Check if events display or empty state shows

## Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Check Health Endpoint

```
https://your-deployment-url.com/api/health
```

**If "status": "unhealthy":**

- Check environment variables in deployment
- Verify Supabase URL and keys are correct
- Check DATABASE_URL is set

**If endpoint returns 404:**

- API routes not building correctly
- Check deployment platform supports API routes
- Rebuild and redeploy

### Step 2: Check Events API

```
https://your-deployment-url.com/api/events
```

**If returns 500 error:**

- Check deployment logs
- Verify database connection
- Check Supabase credentials

**If returns empty array `{"events": []}`:**

- No events in database
- Check Supabase dashboard → Table Editor → events
- Query: `SELECT * FROM events;`
- If no events, create test event via admin panel

**If returns 404:**

- Same as health endpoint 404

### Step 3: Check Browser Console

Open your deployed site → F12 → Console

**Look for:**

1. "Fetching events from /api/events..."
2. "Response status: 200"
3. "Total events fetched: X"

**If you see errors:**

- Note the exact error message
- Check if it's CORS, network, or API error
- Follow specific error guidance in DEPLOYMENT_DEBUGGING.md

### Step 4: Verify Database Has Events

In Supabase dashboard:

```sql
SELECT id, title, status, featured, date
FROM events
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**If no events:**

1. Go to your deployed admin panel: `/admin/create-event`
2. Create a test event
3. Refresh home page

**If events exist but not showing:**

- Check `status` field (should be 'UPCOMING', 'ONGOING', or 'COMPLETED')
- Check `featured` field
- Verify events have required fields (title, date, price, etc.)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Response status: 404"

**Cause:** API routes not deployed
**Fix:**

- Check next.config.mjs
- Ensure no API routes are excluded
- Rebuild: `npm run build`

### Issue: "Response status: 500"

**Cause:** Database connection failed
**Fix:**

- Check environment variables
- Verify Supabase credentials
- Check Supabase service status

### Issue: "Total events fetched: 0"

**Cause:** No events in database or query filtering all out
**Fix:**

- Add events via admin panel
- Check database directly
- Review API query filters

### Issue: Events show locally but not deployed

**Cause:** Environment variables not set in deployment
**Fix:**

- Go to deployment platform settings
- Add all required environment variables
- Redeploy after adding

### Issue: CORS errors

**Cause:** Cross-origin restrictions
**Fix:**

- Add CORS headers to API routes
- Check deployment platform CORS settings

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in your deployment platform:

```env
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-deployment-url.com

# Firebase (if using)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
(etc.)
```

## Testing Locally Before Deploy

1. Build production version:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

2. Test in browser:

- Visit http://localhost:3000
- Check console for logs
- Verify events display

3. If works locally but not deployed:

- Environment variables issue
- Database access restriction
- Deployment platform issue

## Quick Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health

# Test events API
curl https://your-domain.com/api/events

# Check if returns JSON
curl -H "Accept: application/json" https://your-domain.com/api/events
```

## Success Indicators

✅ `/api/health` returns `"status": "healthy"`
✅ `/api/events` returns array with events
✅ Browser console shows "Total events fetched: X" (X > 0)
✅ Home page displays event cards
✅ /events page displays event cards
✅ No console errors
✅ Images load correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy** these changes
2. **Visit** `/api/health` endpoint
3. **Check** browser console on home page
4. **Review** deployment logs if issues persist
5. **Follow** DEPLOYMENT_DEBUGGING.md for detailed troubleshooting
